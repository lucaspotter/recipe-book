# For those wishing to add a recipe:

Step 1 - Find a recipe.

Bonus points if you make it yourself or take it from your grandmother.<hr>

Step 2.1 - Make a pull request

I can very easily merge with yours and you get contributor credit in that little corner on the sidebar

Bonus points if you still make an issue, better for organization<hr>

Step 2.2 - Transcribe your recipe

Bonus points if you do it in Markdown, making my job easier<hr>

Step 2.3 - Attach something in a issue

You can attach a photo/photocopy of the recipe and leave the transcribing to me

(or attach the markdown file if you did that on 2.2)<hr>

Step 3 - Pleasantly wait

I'll do what I must with what you've given me, and you'll be notified when it's added, denied, or I need assistance with something<hr>

Thank you!
