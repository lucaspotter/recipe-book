***freedom ramen***
*for when democracy dies in the hands of the few*

**ingredients:**
*- ONE beef ramen pack*
*- TWO eggy*
*- SLAB of deli ham*
*- ONE tablespoon of butter*
*- everything but the bagel seasoning TO TASTE*

**directions:**
first, we'll do some prep. throw your slice of actual deli ham (not the sandwich stuff) onto a cutting board and dice into small chunks. how big exactly is up to you.
crack your eggs into a bowl and fuck em up with a fork. we're doing scrambled eggs.

stove time! add your butter to the pan and let it melt. add in ham chunks and fry to your preference.
i prefer frying until some are golden brown. once fried, add eggy to your pan. cook eggy to preference. once complete, slide pan off to side.

in a pot, boil water. prepare your ramen with the instructions on the back. i add some everything but the bagel seasoning for flavor because it's a good all-in-one thing.

combine finished ramen and egg-ham mixture in a bowl of your choosing.

add the death of democracy to taste.

enjoy!
