***kickass hot choccy***
*chestnuts roasting on an open fire*

**ingredients:**
*- 2 tbsp cocoa powder*
*- 2 tbsp sugar*
*- 1/4 tsp vanilla extract*
*- 1 cup milk*
*- pinch of salt*

**directions:**
first you gotta mix the cocoa powder, sugar, and salt in a mug. microwave the milk for 1 minute. it's probably better if you actually try boiling it but yknow

stir the hot milk and cocoa mix together add vanilla extract to the hot choccy to taste. i said 1/4 tsp and that's good but hey! we're all different.

mix well, and...

cha cha real smooth.

enjoy!
