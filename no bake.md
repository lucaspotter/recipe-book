***no bake cookies***
*just how grammy used to make em*

**ingredients:**
*- 2 tbsp cocoa powder*
*- 2 cups sugar*
*- 1 stick oleo (margarine, butter)*
*- 1/2 cup milk*
*- 3 cups instant oats*
*- 1 tsp vanilla extract*
*- 1/2 cup peanut butter*

**what is oleo?**
that's what i thought too. oleo is really just another word for margarine, a butter substitute.
it is commonly called oleo in older recipes.

**directions:**
combine the cocoa, sugar, oleo, and milk in a saucepan. stir well, and bring to a boil. let boil for one minute

afterwards, take off heat and add the oats, vanilla, and peanut butter. stir well.

take your concoction and use an ice cream scoop or just a spoon to make little balls of dough. put said balls <!-- in your mouth --> on a sheet of waxed paper.

let rest for a good while, how long is personal preference. then again you can't finish these in one sitting so it don't matter

enjoy!
